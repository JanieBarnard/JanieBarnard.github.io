            <i><b>Vanilla</b></i> - 4/10
            <br>
            Let's start with the most basic. Vanilla is like the color white, it is not a flavor but a lack there of. It is boring and not even worth the calories. The only reason to ever eat vanilla icecream is on a brownie, pie, blueberry crisp, ect.

            <i><b>Chocolate</b></i> - 8/10
            <br>
            Always a good go to, especially when there is a lack of other options. It goes well with toppings or other desserts but is also good on its own. When in doubt, choose chocolate.

            <i><b>Strawberry</b></i> - 5/10
            <br>
            This one is hit or miss. Occasionally you can find a good version, but most are either way too sweet or filled with gross chunks of frozen fruit. To be clear, I have no problem with frozen fruit, but it does not belong in icecream.
